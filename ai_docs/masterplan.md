# hueJitsu - Design System Builder Masterplan

## App Overview and Objectives

hueJitsu is a web-based design system builder specifically created for developers who want to create cohesive, professional design systems without requiring deep design expertise. The app enables users to visually construct comprehensive design systems covering colors, typography, spacing, and component styling, then export them in formats ready for implementation in modern web development workflows.

### Core Mission

Bridge the gap between design and development by providing guided design system creation with immediate visual feedback and practical code exports.

### Value Proposition

- **For developers**: Create professional design systems without design expertise
- **For teams**: Maintain consistency across projects with systematic design tokens
- **For productivity**: Eliminate guesswork in design decisions through guided, theory-based recommendations

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

- **Frontend developers** using modern frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue)
- **Full-stack developers** building complete applications
- **Solo developers** and small teams without dedicated designers
- **Developers using utility-first CSS frameworks** (Tailwind CSS, ShadCN)

### User Personas
